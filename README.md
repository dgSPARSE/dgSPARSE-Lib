## Introdution

The dgSPARSE Library (Deep Graph Sparse Library) is a high performance library for sparse kernel acceleration on GPUs based on CUDA.

## File Structure

```
.
├── include:
│   └── dgsparse.h: The header file of the dgSPARSE Library.
├── lib:
│   └── dgsparse.so: The dynamic link file of the dgSPARSE Library.
└── src: Some source codes and references of implementations in the dgSPARSE Library.
    └── ge-spmm: GE-SpMM implementation.
```

## Run Examples

Check your environment.
``` bash
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda # your cuda path
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64
```

Then build dgsparse through `make exp`.
You could run our kernels in the example folder.
